/// <summary>
/// Port-only: a drop-down list for the logistics screens (the preferences screen's DIFFICULTY and RENDERER). A field
/// shows the current choice; a click opens a list of the choices below it, a click on a row chooses it. The control
/// edits a setting it points at (its model): what it shows is always the setting's value, so a setting changed
/// elsewhere (CANCEL putting the old one back) shows at once. It draws every frame from its state, in the preferences
/// panel's style: a 0x14 outline, white font in 0xe3, the hovered row lit in 0x14.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// While open the control is taller (the list is part of it), in front of its siblings and holds the mouse grab, so
/// every mouse and key event comes to it until it closes: a press outside closes it without a change. A choice that
/// changes the setting runs the changed routine once, after the grab is let go.
/// Mouse: a click on the field opens or closes; a release over a row chooses it (also at the end of a drag from the
/// field); the wheel moves the choice (closed) or the lit row (open). Keys: up and down do the same, Return chooses the
/// lit row, Escape closes. Keys reach a closed control while the mouse is over it, as for every logistics control.
