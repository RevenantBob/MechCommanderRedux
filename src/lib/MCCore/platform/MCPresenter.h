// The frame half of the renderer: what turns the screen the game drew (8-bit, with its op plane and underlays) into
// the picture in the window. MCDisplay owns the window, the screen buffer and the palette, and hands each frame to a
// presenter. MCVulkanPresenter composites and scales on the GPU (SDL GPU, Vulkan, HLSL shaders); MCSdlPresenter, the
// software renderer's, composites on the CPU and shows the result with SDL's 2D renderer.
