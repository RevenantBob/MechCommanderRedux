/// <remarks>
/// <para>Commands are recorded as they come (resolved into draws: shaders/instance.vshader's <c>Draw</c>) and run when the
/// frame is presented (<see cref="Execute"/>), in order, so the presenter composites what they drew. What a command
/// reads is taken at the time of the call, as the software renderer reads it: shapes, tiles, fast shapes and glyphs are
/// decoded into an atlas (value + state), kept by the address they're read from in a registered data block until its
/// owner says the bytes changed (<see cref="MCRenderer::RegisterData"/>); pictures are their textures
/// (<see cref="MCTexture"/>); tables get a row of the table texture, kept by their address in the same way.</para>
/// <para>A surface holds colours (premultiplied RGBA, what the composite shows) and palette indices (what draws that
/// read a surface read, see shaders/draw.pshader). Opaque draws write both, with the frame's palette; translucent and
/// table-mapped draws are alpha blended into the colours by the GPU's blend (AlphaPal.ini's colours, not AlphaTable's)
/// and never read the target. A copy within a surface reads a copy of its indices taken before it; consecutive such
/// draws that don't touch each other's pixels share one copy.</para>
/// <para>Integer arithmetic throughout: the GPU writes the software renderer's indices exactly wherever nothing was
/// blended. Mirror mode (<see cref="MCGpuDrawing::Mirror"/>) draws both and compares them every frame
