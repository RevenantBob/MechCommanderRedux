/// A development aid: on an unhandled crash, prints the exception and a symbolized call stack to stderr, runs the
/// reporter (game state worth knowing), and writes a minidump next to the executable (MCRedux.dmp or mc_tests.dmp, open
/// it in Visual Studio with the PDB beside it) before the process dies. The CRT's own failures (a Debug assertion such
/// as a checked iterator's, abort(), an invalid parameter, a pure virtual call) are reported the same way, with no
/// dialog. Without a terminal, the report goes to MCRedux.crash.txt
/// beside the executable instead, and a message box says where. Windows only (DbgHelp and the build's PDB); elsewhere
/// <see cref="Install"/> does nothing.
